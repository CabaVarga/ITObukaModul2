Useful snippets in Visual Studio for creating properties:  
`prop` - creates an [auto-implemented property] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties)  
`propfull` - creates a property with get and set accessors (hint: creates field and property at the same time. if you want to create multiple properties without having to cut / paste the fields, you need to create every new one between the field and property of the previously created one)
